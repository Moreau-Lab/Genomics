Comparative Genomic Analysis Workflow
================
Megan Barkdull

## Introduction

This repository hosts the workflow for a comparative genomics analysis.
The general overview is: ![the workflow begins with downloading sequence
files, then you identify orthologous genes with Orthofinder, then you
test your hypotheses](./ComparativeGenomicsWorkflow.png)

Currently, all of the steps of the workflow are found in
AntComparativeGenomicsScript.txt. Please note that this is very much a
work in progress\!

For the step where you must convert the outputs of OrthoFinder to be
inputs for RERConverge, please see the [Comparative Genomics
repository](https://github.com/mbarkdull/ComparativeGenomics)
