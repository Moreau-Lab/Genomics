# Log onto the remote machine:
ssh  labid@cbsuwrkstX.tc.cornell.edu

# Make my own directory in the work directory, and set that directory to my working directory:
mkdir
cd 

# On the remote machine, download the ant genomes 
	## I'm considering instead using wget -i inputfile, so that I can have a text file "inputfile" that lists all the urls for the ant genomes and I'll only have to run wget once. 
	## I also need to talk to Corrie to find out which specific files I need to download.
wget https://antgenomes.org/downloads/annotations/Acromyrmex_echinatior/Aech_3.7_Apollo.tgz

# Annotate the genomes with Maker

	## "MAKER's annotations can be easily updated with new evidence by passing existing annotation sets back though MAKER."
	
	## I think this will also require downloading references for annotation (RNA and protein sequences from related organisms(which?))
