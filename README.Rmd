## Introduction

This repository hosts the workflow for a comparative genomics analysis. The general overview is:
![the workflow begins with downloading sequence files, then you identify orthologous genes with Orthofinder, then you test your hypotheses](./ComparativeGenomicsWorkflow.png)

Currently, all of the steps of the workflow are found in AntComparativeGenomicsScript.txt. Please note that this is very much a work in progress!

For the step where you must convert the outputs of OrthoFinder to be inputs for RERConverge, please see the [Comparative Genomics repository](https://github.com/mbarkdull/ComparativeGenomics)
